        <section id=explain>
            <p>We stand out because we are different. When you come to Waffle Works, you don't just get a normal waffle. It is a gourmet waffle wrapped around a stick, with toppings filled inside. We have many different fillings. You can choose from two waffle sticks, waffle bites, or a belgian waffle. </p>
